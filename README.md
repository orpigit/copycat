The Copycat cryptocurrency based on the ERC-20 standard has been created to support and help the development of the Vechain project.
Initially, the Copycat cryptocurrency aims to provide the ecosystem of Vechain (VET) and Vethor (Vtho) cryptocurrency holders with additional utilities to foster a secure environment where they can collectively pool their assets in order to access extraordinary benefits on them. 

The use of the Copycat cryptocurrency, through its native Uri token, aims to:
1 Give access to all Vechain holders to participate on a subrogated basis to nodes in the Vechain network by obtaining in return rewards in the form of Vthor and Uri tokens.
2 Generate sufficient volume of users to be able to invest in existing pools to earn higher returns on cryptocurrency pairs based on the Vechain ecosystem, compared to standard pools.
3 Create an ecosystem of rewards in different cryptocurrencies, betting a minimum amount of Vthor or Uri in order to obtain higher rewards.
4. Allow copycat users the possibility of accessing the launch of projects in the Vechain network or airdrops quickly, clearly and, as far as possible, with preference over other users.

50000000 of Uri tokens have been generated with the aim of giving access to all those interested in this promising project, open to large collaborations.
